% Parameters configuration file for PoseEstimation, this file must have a .conf extension
% Comments are done with '%' at start of line
% Each line must contain a [Token]=[Value] pair and nothing else (white spaces get trimmed), for values 
% representing measures (i.e. vgridLeafSize, value of 1 equals 1 meter)

% Possible [Token] and corresponding [Value] are:
% ________________________________________________________________________________________________________
% [Token]         [Value](default)            Description
% useVFH          true/false (true)           Tell PoseEstimation to use also VFH descriptor in matching
% useESF          true/false (true)           Tell PoseEstimation to use also ESF descriptor in matching
% useCVFH         true/false (true)           Tell PoseEstimation to use also CVFH descriptor in matching
% useOURCVFH      true/false (true)           Tell PoseEstimation to use also OURCVFH descriptor in matching
% downsampling    true/false (true)           Tell PoseEstimation to downsample the query with VoxelGrid
% vgridLeafSize   float >0 (0.003)            Set the leaf size of VoxelGrid downsampling to [Value],
%                                             only relevant if downsampling=true
% upsampling      true/false (false)          Tell PoseEstimation to upsample the query with MLS random
%                                             uniform density, before the eventual downsampling
% filtering       true/false (false)          Tell PoseEstimation to filter the query with Statistical 
%                                             Outliers Filter, before the eventual upsampling and downsampling
% progBisection   true/false (true)           Tell PoseEstimation to use Progressive Bisection, instead of Brute
%                                             Force, during candidates refinement
% kNeighbors      int >0 (20)                 How many neighbors to retrieve during matching phase, this value determines
%                                             the length of each candidate list
% maxIterations   int >0 (200)                Maximum iterations of ICP for each candidate during Brute Force
%                                             Candidate Refinement, relevant only if progBisection=false
% progItera       int >0 (5)                  ICP iterations to perform for all candidates on each step of Progressive Bisection
%                                             Candidate Refinement, relevant only if progBisection=true
% progFraction    float >0 <1 (0.5)           Fraction of candidate list to keep after each step of Progressive

% rmseThreshold   float >=0 (0.003)           RMSE Threshold during Candidate Refinement, when a candidate rmse
%                                             falls below this threshold, the procedure terminates. If progBisection=true
%                                             this can be set to zero to always choose the surviving candidate at
%                                             the end of progressive bisection

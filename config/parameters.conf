% useSOasViewpoint    1/0 (1)                Tell PoseEstimation to use the sensor_origin_ member of query point cloud
%                                            as the viewpoint for every operation, where a viewpoint is need, i.e in
%                                            normals estimation or in VFH descriptor. If set to '0' a viewpoint must be set manually with
%                                            member function setQueryViewpoint or features will refuse to compute.
%                                            If set to '1' and sensor_origin_ is not representing a correct viewpoint, unexpected results may happen,
%                                            such as normals not correctly oriented, probably resulting in a wrong pose estimation

% computeViewpointFromName 1/0 (0)           If set to '1' PoseEstimation will try to calculate the viewpoint from the query name,
%                                            NOTE however that to use this feature query names should follow a naming convenction, that is
%                                            name_latitude_longitude (i.e Funnel_30_60). Note also that setting this parameter to 1
%                                            will override 'useSOasViewpoint' param, regardless of its value. If set to 0 and also 'useSOasViewpoint'
%                                            is set to 0 a view point must be supplied with setQueryViewpoint, or feature will refuse to compute
